# ACT &amp; MFPS List of Talks

## Joint ACT &amp; MFPS keynote

<!-- [Andrew Pitts](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~amp12/) (University of Cambridge) &mdash; _Toposes of Finitely Supported M-Sets_-->
* <details><summary><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~amp12/">Andrew Pitts</a> (University of Cambridge) &mdash; <a><i>Toposes of Finitely Supported M-Sets</i></a></summary>
For at least the last 25 years several toposes of finitely supported
M-sets (for various monoids M) have played an important role in my
work on logic and computer science, but in apparently unconnected
ways. I feel that this kind of topos is trying to get my attention. So
I will use this talk to tell you what they are; some of their nice
(and not so nice) properties; and a little about the contexts in which
they have arisen for me, namely the mathematics of syntax involving
binders and the semantics of univalent type theories. My hope is that
you will also find them useful, or be able to tell me something about
them that I don't know. For example, I do not know an abstract
characterisation of this class of topos. </details>


## Joint ACT &amp; MFPS special session in memory of Phil Scott

* <details><summary><a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-science/professors/richard-blute">Rick Blute</a> (University of Ottawa, organizer) &mdash; <a><i>Proofs, Types and Hexagons</i></a></summary>
Phil’s book with Jim Lambek “Introduction to Higher-Order Categorical Logic” is a seminal work in category theory. It cemented in the minds of many of us working in the field the idea that the best approach to studying logical systems was to form a category whose objects are formulas and arrows are proofs of entailments. Extensions of this idea are an obsession of the categorical logic community to this day.<br>One of the most interesting extensions involves representing formulas as multivariant functors and thus proofs become dinatural transformations, the hexagons of the title. The problem/challenge that arises is that these transformations need not compose.  This has led to a great deal of interesting category theory, much of which Phil contributed to. I’ll review some of these results, especially those relating to linear logic.</details>
* <details><summary><a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/samson.abramsky/">Samson Abramsky</a> (University of Oxford) &mdash; <a><i>Retracing GoI with Phil</i></a></summary>
I will describe  my collaboration with Phil Scott and Esfandiar Haghverdi on categorical semantics of Geometry of Interaction. I will say something about the context of this work, and where it led.</details>
* [Robin Cockett](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~robin/)
* <details><summary><a href="https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/mark-lawson">Mark Lawson</a> (Heriot-Watt University) &mdash; 
<a><i>Co-ordinatizing an MV-algebra by a Boolean inverse monoid</i></a></summary>
Both MV-algebras (which arise from multiple valued logic)
and Boolean inverse monoids (which partake in a generalization of classical Stone duality)
are generalizations of Boolean algebras.
The question is: how are they related?
Phil Scott and I proved that every countable MV-algebra can be co-ordinatized
by a suitable Boolean inverse monoid (in a sense analogous to classical work by von Neumann).
I shall assume no prior exposure to MV-algebras or Boolean inverse monoids
in my talk.</details>

## MFPS invited speakers

* [Philippa Gardner](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pg/) (Imperial College, London, UK)
* <details><summary><a href="https://denotational.co.uk">Ohad Kammar</a> (University of Edinburgh) &mdash; <a><i>Semantic foundations for type-driven probabilistic modelling</i></a></summary>
The last few years have seen several breakthroughs in the semantic
foundations of probabilistic and statistical modelling. Types show
clear promise in organising intricate models and the inference
algorithms we use to fit them to data. I will present a type-rich and
straightforward model, the quasi Borel space, and survey recent and
ongoing developments in this area.</details>

## MFPS special session on the semantics of non-wellfounded and circular proofs

Organisers: [Anupam Das](https://www.anupamdas.com) and [Abhishek De](https://sites.google.com/view/abhishekde) (University of Birmingham).

* <details><summary><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/farzadjafarrahmani/home">Farzad Jafarrahmani</a> ((LMCRC), Huawei) &mdash; <a><i>Focused orthogonality as denotations of circular and non-wellfounded proofs</i></a></summary>
This talk investigates the question of denotational invariants of non-wellfounded and circular proofs of the linear logic with least and greatest fixpoints. While non-wellfounded and circular proof theory has made significant progress in the last twenty years, the corresponding denotational semantics is still underdeveloped. First, we explore a theory of fixpoint constructions in focused orthogonality categories and present a lifting theorem for initial algebras and final coalgebras. These constructions crucially hinge on the insight that focused orthogonality categories are relational fibrations. We then demonstrate that assuming a CPO structure on our category allows the focused orthogonality construction to provide a model for non-wellfounded proofs. Several properties of the semantics will be discussed, including its soundness, the relationship between totality (orthogonality) and validity, and the semantic content involved in translating finitary proofs to circular proofs. Finally, the talk focuses on circular proofs, aiming to leverage their regularity to define the interpretation function inductively. We argue why the usual validity condition is too general for this purpose, while a fragment of circular proofs—strongly valid proofs—constitutes a well-behaved class for such an inductive interpretation.</details>
* <details><summary><a href="http://gauss.cs.iit.edu/~fderakhshan/">Farzaneh Derakhshan</a> (Illinois Tech) &mdash; <a><i>Session-Typed Recursive Processes and Infinitary Proofs</i></a></summary>
Session types describe the communication behavior of interacting processes. Binary session types, in which each channel has two endpoints, corresponds to intuitionistic linear logic by a Curry-Howard interpretation of propositions as types, proofs as programs, and cut reduction as communication. This interpretation provides a solid foundation for reasoning about the behavior of session-typed processes. For example, termination of a process can be inferred from the cut elimination property of its underlying proof. However, as soon as we add recursive session types, we abandon this correspondence and lose our solid ground. From the programming perspective, it means that we can no longer exploit the cut elimination property to guarantee termination. In this talk, I show how we can revitalize the logical foundation for recursive binary session-typed processes by using infinitary proof systems for linear logic. We show that if we refine recursive types as least and greatest fixed points and impose a guard condition on recursive processes, we can still guarantee meaningful communication, ensuring that a program always terminates either in an empty configuration or one attempting to communicate along external channels.</details>
* <details><summary><a href="https://gianlucacurzi.com/">Gianluca Curzi</a> (University of Gothenburg) &mdash; <a><i>Computational aspects of cyclic and non-wellfounded proofs</i></a></summary>
Non-wellfounded proof theory studies a more permissive notion of proof seen as a possibly infinite (but finitely branching) tree structure. Cyclic proofs are special non-wellfounded proofs whose underlying tree is regular, thereby they admit a finite presentation in terms of finite (possibly cyclic) graphs. Over the years, cyclic and non-wellfounded proofs have received growing interest, especially given their capability of subsuming various forms of (co)inductive reasoning and, under a computational reading, (co)recursion mechanisms. This talk is meant to provide a bird's eye view of the state-of-the-art research around the computational analysis of cyclic and non-wellfounded proof systems, with special attention to the speaker's contribution on the topic. More specifically, the talk will examine a number of systems, spanning from those expressing complex forms of ordinal and higher-order recursion down to those implementing quickly converging recursion schemes suitable for complexity-theoretic considerations.</details>
