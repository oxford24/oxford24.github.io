Pages should go in the root, see e.g. index.html or tutorial.md. 
To add a page to the nav bar, edit _layouts/actmfps.html.

If you begin your page with

---
layout: actmfps
---

then the nav bar will appear and will be automatically updated as the site changes. 
The actual site (_site) is generated automatically each time there is a push to the github repository.
