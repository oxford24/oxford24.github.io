# ACT: Applied Category Theory

## Call for papers

The Seventh International Conference on Applied Category Theory will take place at the University of Oxford from 17 - 21 June 2024, preceded by the Adjoint School 2024 from 10-14 July. This year, the ACT Conference will be co-located with the 40th Conference on Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS). This conference follows previous events at University of Maryland College Park (MD), Strathclyde (UK), Cambridge (UK), Cambridge (MA), Oxford (UK) and Leiden (NL). 

Applied category theory is important to a growing community of researchers who study computer science, logic, engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, social science, systems, linguistics and other subjects using category-theoretic tools. The background and experience of our members is as varied as the systems being studied. The goal of the Applied Category Theory conference series is to bring researchers together, strengthen the applied category theory community, disseminate the latest results, and facilitate further development of the field.

* June 17â€“21: conference

### Submissions 



The submission URL is:
[https://openreview.net/group?id=AppliedCategoryTheory.org/ACT/2024/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=AppliedCategoryTheory.org/ACT/2024/Conference).
Please allow time to create an OpenReview account. 

We accept submissions in English of original research papers, talks about work accepted/submitted/published elsewhere, and demonstrations of relevant software. Accepted original research papers will be published in a proceedings volume. The conference will include an industry showcase event and community meeting. We particularly encourage people from underrepresented groups to submit their work and the organizers are committed to non-discrimination, equity, and inclusion.

* Conference Papers should present original, high-quality work in the style of a computer science conference paper (up to 12 pages, not counting the bibliography; more detailed parts of proofs may be included in an appendix for the convenience of the reviewers). Such submissions should not be an abridged version of an existing journal article although pre-submission arXiv preprints are permitted. These submissions will be adjudicated for both a talk and publication in the conference proceedings.

* Talk proposals not to be published in the proceedings, e.g. about work accepted/submitted/published elsewhere, should be submitted as abstracts, one or two pages long. Authors are encouraged to include links to any full versions of their papers, preprints or manuscripts. The purpose of the abstract is to provide a basis for determining the topics and quality of the anticipated presentation.

* Software demonstration proposals should also be submitted as abstracts, one or two pages. The purpose of the abstract is to provide the program committee with enough information to assess the content of the demonstration. 

The selected conference papers are expected to be published with EPTCS, and authors are advised to use the style files available at [style.eptcs.org](https://style.eptcs.org).

Reviewing will be single-blind, and we are not making public the reviews, reviewer names, the discussions nor the list of under-review submissions. This is the same as previous instances of ACT.

In order to give our reviewers enough time to bid on submissions, we ask for a title and brief abstract of your submission by March 26. 
For all planned submissions, please do provide a title and short text abstract by March 26.
The full two-page pdf extended abstract submissions and up to 14 page proceedings submissions are both due by the submissions deadline of March 29 11:59pm aoe.


Please contact the organisers for more information: 
David Jaz Myers (Abu Dhabi) and Michael Johnson (Sydney).
