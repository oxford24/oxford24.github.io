# Location and venue

The conferences will be based in and around the Department of Computer Science in Oxford, on the corner of Parks Road and Keble Road. See [access guide](https://www.accessguide.ox.ac.uk/8-11-keble-road-and-wolfson-building) and [Google map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WSeQuTsg3w4ZL8VQ8).

* For accommodation, Oxford is always busy so you should book in advance. As well as the usual routes ([airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/oxford-united-kingdom/stays/apartments) and [booking sites](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotels-g186361-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England-Hotels.html)) you can try [universityrooms](https://www.universityrooms.com/en-GB/city/oxford/home/). If you are looking at accommodation beyond walking distance, note that our venue is very near to the bus stops at St Giles' Church, on Banbury Road and Woodstock Road (see [Oxford Bus](https://images-oxfordbus.passenger-website.com/2023-08/SmartZone%20Network%20Map%20-%2027th%20August%202023.pdf) for an overview), and Oxford is reasonably friendly for renting a bike --- many locals cycle around. 

* Oxford is connected by [rail](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk) and bus ([Tube](https://www.oxfordtube.com) / [National Express](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en/help/coach-stations/oxford)). There is convenient access to Heathrow and Birmingham airports, and slightly less convenient access to other London airports.

* There will be a registration fee to cover room hire and so on. We are trying to keep it very low. (This is in common with MFPS 2023 but not ACT 2023.) 

* For any general enquiries, please contact [Sam](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/samuel.staton/main.html).
