# Registration

Please register at the [Oxford University Store](https://www.oxforduniversitystores.co.uk/conferences-and-events/computer-science/events/applied-category-theory-and-mathematical-foundations-of-programming-semantics-co-located-conference). 

There is an option on the form for an MFPS dinner. This is an option for all delegates. (For example, if you are giving a talk at ACT but would like to be part of the MFPS dinner you are welcome to sign up for it.) We are planning it for Wednesday 19 June after the session in memory of Phil Scott. We may also need to close the MFPS dinner registration early, possibly as early as 5 June.

For those that don't need to pay, for example special session speakers, we will be in touch separately with a different form. 

Although this is planned as an in-person event, we are hoping to stream the talks, and there will be separate registraton route for that nearer the time. If you are hoping to present a talk remotely, please contact the programme chairs. 

Early registration fees:

    * Five days student: £40 
    * Wed-Fri student: £30 
    * Five days: £140 
    * Wed-Fri:  £110 
    * MFPS dinner: £50

**Early registration closes 31 May 2024**. 

Registration does not include meals or accommodation.



# Location and getting here

The conferences will be based in and around the Department of Computer Science in Oxford, on the corner of Parks Road and Keble Road. See [access guide](https://www.accessguide.ox.ac.uk/8-11-keble-road-and-wolfson-building) and [Google map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WSeQuTsg3w4ZL8VQ8).

Oxford is connected by [rail](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk) and bus ([Tube](https://www.oxfordtube.com) / [National Express](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en/help/coach-stations/oxford)). There is convenient access to Heathrow and Birmingham airports, and slightly less convenient access to other London airports. See also the [University guide to getting here](https://www.ox.ac.uk/visitors/visiting-oxford/how-get-oxford). 

Our venue is very near to the bus stops at St Giles' Church, on Banbury Road and Woodstock Road, but not all bus routes stop there (see [Oxford Bus](https://images-oxfordbus.passenger-website.com/2023-08/SmartZone%20Network%20Map%20-%2027th%20August%202023.pdf) for an overview). So you could look for somewhere on those bus lines. Oxford is also reasonably friendly for renting a bike, and many locals cycle around. 

# Accommodation

As well as the usual routes ([airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/oxford-united-kingdom/stays/apartments) and [booking sites](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotels-g186361-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England-Hotels.html)) you can try [universityrooms](https://www.universityrooms.com/en-GB/city/oxford/home/). I will update this page if other routes emerge. 
 
 Oxford is always busy. I am told that some university accommodation is likely to become available later in May once the undergraduate students decide when they are leaving. Please fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/jGCWfjG6N2QGM8vPA) if you would like to be notified if and when university accommodation becomes available. Please note nothing is guaranteed by filling in this form.

Further afield, you could look at the bus routes. For example, the Pear Tree Park-and-Ride is a 10-15 minute bus ride and has a [Travelodge](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g186361-d1027077-Reviews-Travelodge_Oxford_Peartree_Hotel-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html) and a [Holiday Inn](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g186361-d226318-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Oxford_an_IHG_Hotel-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html?m=19905), which could be cheaper options.
