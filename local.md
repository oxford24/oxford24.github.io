# Registration

Please register at the [Oxford University Store](https://www.oxforduniversitystores.co.uk/conferences-and-events/computer-science/events/applied-category-theory-and-mathematical-foundations-of-programming-semantics-co-located-conference). 

Early registration fees:

* Five days student: £40 
* Wed-Fri student: £30 
* Five days: £140 
* Wed-Fri:  £110 
* MFPS dinner: £50

**Early registration closes 31 May 2024**. 

Registration does not include any meals or accommodation.

There is an option during registration for an MFPS dinner. This is an option for all. (For example, if you are giving a talk at ACT but would like to be part of the MFPS dinner then you are very welcome to sign up for it.) We are planning it for Wednesday 19 June after the session in memory of Phil Scott. We may need to close the MFPS dinner registration well in advance of the conference so please sign up earlier if you would like to come.

 The conference is planned mainly as an in-person event and the registration here is on that basis. Nonetheless we are hoping to stream the talks, and there will be a separate registration route for that nearer the time. If you are hoping to present a talk remotely, please contact the programme chairs. 




# Location and getting here

The conferences will be based in and around the Department of Computer Science in Oxford, on the corner of Parks Road and Keble Road. See [access guide](https://www.accessguide.ox.ac.uk/8-11-keble-road-and-wolfson-building) and [Google map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WSeQuTsg3w4ZL8VQ8).

Oxford is connected by [rail](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk) and bus ([Tube](https://www.oxfordtube.com) / [National Express](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en/help/coach-stations/oxford)). There is convenient access to Heathrow and Birmingham airports, and slightly less convenient access to other London airports. See also the [University guide to getting here](https://www.ox.ac.uk/visitors/visiting-oxford/how-get-oxford). 

Our venue is very near to the bus stops at St Giles' Church, on Banbury Road and Woodstock Road, but not all bus routes stop there (see [Oxford Bus](https://images-oxfordbus.passenger-website.com/2023-08/SmartZone%20Network%20Map%20-%2027th%20August%202023.pdf) for an overview). Oxford is also reasonably friendly for renting a bike, and many locals cycle around. 

# Accommodation

As well as the usual routes ([booking sites](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotels-g186361-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England-Hotels.html) and [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/oxford-united-kingdom/stays/apartments)) you can try [universityrooms](https://www.universityrooms.com/en-GB/city/oxford/home/). 
 
The Oxford Pear Tree Park-and-Ride is a 10-15 minute non-stop bus ride and has a [Travelodge](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g186361-d1027077-Reviews-Travelodge_Oxford_Peartree_Hotel-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html) and a [Holiday Inn](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g186361-d226318-Reviews-Holiday_Inn_Oxford_an_IHG_Hotel-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html?m=19905), which could be cheaper options. You could look at other bus routes too (see bus info above). 

 Please fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/jGCWfjG6N2QGM8vPA) if you would like to be notified if and when university accommodation becomes available. I am told that some university accommodation is likely to become available later in May once the undergraduate students decide when they are leaving. Please note nothing is guaranteed by filling in this form.
