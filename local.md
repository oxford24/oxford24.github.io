# Location and venue

The conference will be based in and around the Department of Computer Science in Oxford, on the corner of Parks Road and Keble Road. See [access guide](https://www.accessguide.ox.ac.uk/8-11-keble-road-and-wolfson-building) and [Google map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WSeQuTsg3w4ZL8VQ8).

For accommodation, Oxford is always busy so you should book in advance. As well as the usual routes ([airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk) and booking sites) you can try [universityrooms](https://www.universityrooms.com/en-GB/city/oxford/home/). 

Unlike ACT 2023, there will be a registration fee to cover room hire and so on. We are trying to keep it very low.

For any general enquiries, please contact [Sam](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/samuel.staton/main.html).
