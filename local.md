# Location and venue

The conferences will be based in and around the Department of Computer Science in Oxford, on the corner of Parks Road and Keble Road. See [access guide](https://www.accessguide.ox.ac.uk/8-11-keble-road-and-wolfson-building) and [Google map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WSeQuTsg3w4ZL8VQ8).

* For accommodation, Oxford is always busy. I am told that some university accommodation is likely to become available later in May once the undergraduate students decide when they are leaving. As well as the usual routes ([airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/oxford-united-kingdom/stays/apartments) and [booking sites](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotels-g186361-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England-Hotels.html)) you can try [universityrooms](https://www.universityrooms.com/en-GB/city/oxford/home/). I will update this page if other routes emerge. 

* If you are looking at accommodation beyond walking distance, our venue is very near to the bus stops at St Giles' Church, on Banbury Road and Woodstock Road, but not all bus routes stop there (see [Oxford Bus](https://images-oxfordbus.passenger-website.com/2023-08/SmartZone%20Network%20Map%20-%2027th%20August%202023.pdf) for an overview). So you could look for somewhere on those bus lines. For example, the Pear Tree Park-and-Ride is a 10-15 minute bus ride and has a [Travelodge](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g186361-d1027077-Reviews-Travelodge_Oxford_Peartree_Hotel-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html) and a Holiday Inn, which could be a cheaper option. Oxford is also reasonably friendly for renting a bike, and many locals cycle around. 

* Oxford is connected by [rail](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk) and bus ([Tube](https://www.oxfordtube.com) / [National Express](https://www.nationalexpress.com/en/help/coach-stations/oxford)). There is convenient access to Heathrow and Birmingham airports, and slightly less convenient access to other London airports. See also the [University guide to getting here](https://www.ox.ac.uk/visitors/visiting-oxford/how-get-oxford). 

* There will be a registration fee to cover room hire and so on. Registration is not open yet. Here are approximate earlybird registration fees. Registration does not include meals or accommodation.

 * Five days: £140 
 * Wed-Fri:  £110 
 * Five days student: £40 
 * Wed-Fri student: £30 
 * MFPS banquet: £50 (TBC)
